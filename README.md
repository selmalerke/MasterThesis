# MasterThesis
Code for reproducing the experiments in my master thesis.

To execute the code, go to the file Run.R, where you can specify the experiment you want to run and adjust the parameters. The instructions are given in the Run.R file.

For the models (STAN files), I have adopted Michail Spitieris' structure (https://github.com/MiSpitieris/BC-with-PI-priors/tree/main), but changed it to fit my physics-informed model.
